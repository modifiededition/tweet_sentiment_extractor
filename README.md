## Tweet Sentiment Extractor | An NLP Question-Answering Task| Kaggle Problem

### Description

With all of the tweets circulating every second it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact the company, or a person's, brand for being viral(positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in the language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description? So, Twitter has come up with a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction) in which we need to pick out the part of the tweet(word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.
